<h2 align="center">Hello there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“</h2>

I am a Linux Systems Administrator from Moldova ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡©.

#### About me

- DevOpsing things
- Maintainer of ...
- I contribute to Open Source software
- I answer questions on Stack Overflow
- I like cycling and taking pictures :camera:

<p>I have graduated Alecu Russo Balti State University in 2013, Computer Science and English Language specialty. I am able to think analytically, a skill acquired being a student, as well as to speak fluently English language (see IELTS Academic Test Report Form reference).

My principles in IT are to automate everything as much as possible and to enforce the latest security policies. The way I am doing business is by paying attention to details and scheduling the work for long and short terms. Also I like to document the tasks (aka to write technical documentation) which if being grouped may form a tutorial. This helps me and my colleagues to be productive even when something is forgotten. These tutorials are published on https://www.docs.iprofor.it.

During my previous jobs, among work related skills, I also developed the skills to communicate correctly and understand the client's needs, as well as to execute the required amount of work in time. Amongst other leisure activities the ones that I am fond of are daily cycling and taking wildlife shots.</p>
